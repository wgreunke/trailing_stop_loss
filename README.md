# trailing_stop_loss
A set of python programs that explore what would happen if you had a stop loss that automatically increases with price increases.

Most people set a stop loss when they buy a stock and then forget to change it as price moves up.  These programs examine what would happend if that stop loss is automatically increased as the price increases (trailing stop loss).

There is a behavioral aspect to this about when to get back in the market.  Get in too soon and people could get whiplash / fatigue if it keeps falling.  Too late and you miss a rally.
